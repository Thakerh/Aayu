# Aayu
 Wake call is "wake up"
 Speech Recognition used to record/listen user Used google text to speech to output voice  
 To interact with operating system I used os module in python.  
 It launches application , files and also exit them on command. 
 Pygame to play music, Aayu play, pause, unpause and stop music on command.  
 Webbrowser module to access search on web browser, it searches whatever the user says from python code. 
 This code has specific range of commands, it is not as good as alexa or any other digital assistant but its good work.
 On saying “Take notes” Aayu creates a file and write whatever you say and to stop writing you just need to say “done”.
 on saying launch "appname" it launches application and on saying exit "appname" it closes that application
 I have also added command like open youtube, open facebook, open netflix which directly open them on google
 For math it only does one opration at a time for eg if you say addition it will ask you what you want to add, same for substraction, division and multiplication.
 Playing music is limited to the songs which are in your directory and you have to be specific with the name. you can play, pause, unpause and stop by simple      commands
 "Search" cmd activates the google search engine, once you say search Aayu will ask you what you want to search and it will search what you ask for.
 "find location" cmd activates google maps and it will find whatever locations you want.
 "open folder" cmd will open you computer folders.
 To exit the code you have to say "goodbye" if plays "hasta la vista baby" audio from terminator movie.
